                        As jobs involving technology become more and more required around the globe, this project was made for children in elementary and in middle schools to spark an interest for the STEM field through programs such as Computer Coding, Biomedicine, Engineering, etc. It is interesting to see projects like this that are meant to help kids around the world enjoy learning about programs like computer coding and envision a future for themselves working in that field. I just recently found my passion for computer science, and I wish that I wouldâ€™ve had the opportunity to be a part of this project when I was younger.

                    In order to promote the representation of women in the technology field, this global non-profit recognizes women who do not get a fair chance in the industry. This project helps women in many ways, such as creating a community by becoming a member, by offering them resources to gain more knowledge, by looking for opportunities to shine, by offering scholarships, and more. As a woman who is just starting in the computer science field, I want to have access to the same opportunities as men do, and so I am inspired by projects like this one who help make that possible.
